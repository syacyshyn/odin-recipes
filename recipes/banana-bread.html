    <h1>Banana Bread Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/bread.jpg" alt="slices of baked banana bread">
        <p>
           This is the best banana bread you will ever have, I promise. It's moist and thick at the same time, and you can get really creative with it as well. For example, sometimes we will add extra bananas (the darker, the sweeter!) for a super banana-y flavor, or you can top it with cinnamon and nutmeg if you like a little extra spice. We pretty much make this on a weekly basis.
